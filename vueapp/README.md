### Ash Notes
RUN NPM I AGAIN TO GET VUETIFY OR USE VUE CLI TO GET VUETIFY IN YOUR DEV ENVIRONMENT
IF YOUR HTML SAYS ONLY ONE ELEMENT ALLOWED, JUST USE V-CONTAINER AND SURROUND ALL OF YOUR TEMPLATE IN THAT SO -> 'TEMPLATE -> V-CONTAINER' THEN CLOSE V-CONTAINER AND THEN CLOSE YOUR TEMPLATE,
ALSO WHEN USING ANY LOCAL VARIABLES, LIKE FROM COMPUTED (SHOUDLNT HAVE THOSE) OR FROM DATA, YOU MUST SAY WHAT CONTEXT, SO IF DATA HAS "ERROR" THEN TO USE IN A METHOD YOU MUST USE 'this.ERROR' BUT ONLY FOR JS, HTML CAN FIND IT ON ITS OWN GOOD JOB HTML
